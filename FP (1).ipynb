Since 2015, Seattle has made it its \n#goal to drop the number of accidents to 0 by 2030, using Sweden\u2019s Vision Zero plan. While the number has fallen from over 326 in 2006, \n#the city has a long way to go before it can hit that lofty goal.\n#Even if the people survyve, they are still suffering serious injuries in hundreds of car accidents each year. Those who survive traffic \n#accidents can face hefty medical bills, thousands of dollars in lost wages and property damage, pain and suffering, and lost quality of\n#life. A collision could cause permanent disability, stripping the victim of the life he or she might have had. For compensation for all\n#of these serious losses, car accident victims can turn to the Seattle civil court system.\n#n other words, car accidents are a serious problem for both citizens and the state for all the expenses and inconveniences that it entails. \n#looking for the causes and how to reduce them then becomes a relevant problem.", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "#Data\n#To that end, we will be using the Traffic Records dataset for vehicular accidents in Seattle.
