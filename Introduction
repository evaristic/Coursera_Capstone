Introduction.

Deaths in -or by- automobiles are a pressing public health concern. It is the second leading cause of accidental death in the country.
In 2018, Seattle alone had over 180 traffic accidents that resulted in serious injury or death. Since 2015, Seattle has made it its 
goal to drop the number of accidents to 0 by 2030, using Swedenâ€™s Vision Zero plan. While the number has fallen from over 326 in 2006, 
the city has a long way to go before it can hit that lofty goal.
Even if the people survyve, they are still suffering serious injuries in hundreds of car accidents each year. Those who survive traffic 
accidents can face hefty medical bills, thousands of dollars in lost wages and property damage, pain and suffering, and lost quality of
life. A collision could cause permanent disability, stripping the victim of the life he or she might have had. For compensation for all
of these serious losses, car accident victims can turn to the Seattle civil court system.
In other words, car accidents are a serious problem for both citizens and the state for all the expenses and inconveniences that it entails. 
looking for the causes and how to reduce them then becomes a relevant problem.
